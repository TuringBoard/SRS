\subsection{Battery}
\subsubsection{Description}
A 2500 KW hour, 24 V battery will provide power to the entire system. For the preliminary design, the voltage will be stepped down using a Buck Converter providing ~19V to the Jetson TX2. There will be an open 5V and 3.3V terminal if there is a need to connect external power to sensors and microcontrollers.
