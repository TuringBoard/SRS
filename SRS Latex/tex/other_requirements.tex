The Turing Board has important features that don't quite fit into the other requirements section criteria, leaving it for the other requirements section. These have just as important an impact on the product as other requirements. These are generally the more innovative requirements to implement special features. As our project progresses and grows, these requirements may grow as well, allowing new features to be added.

\subsection{Follow Along}
\subsubsection{Description}
An identifiable marker worn on the rider (around the ankle or back of a shoe) will be recognized and tracked by the CV on the longboard to allow it to follow along with the wearer as they walk or run. The CV will be able to track if the marker is to the left or the right of the camera center and also measure the distance to the marker to help it keep pace with the wearer.
