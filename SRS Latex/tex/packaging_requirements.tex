The Turing Board will be shipped pre-assembled which would include the turning mechanism, camera, and Jetson already screwed onto a standard longboard. The only thing not plugged in would be the batteries which the user has to connect themselves. The firmware for the product will come pre-installed where the user would only be required to pair the device with the mobile app to make use of it. An ankle bracelet with ArUco Tags for the follow me feature and a power supply for charging the batteries would also be included as part of the purchase.

\subsection{Board Design}
\subsubsection{Description}
The look and feel is incredibly important for a final product. It is the polish that makes the shoe shine, after all. The finished longboard topside will have a minimalist look similar to a normal longboard or eboard, custom protective housings for all electrical components on the underside, and Turing Board custom grip tape signed by all team members.

Runtime Terrors
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The electronics and casing mounted to the underside must be thin enough to avoid scraping or bottoming out on bumpy sidewalks.
\subsubsection{Standards}
The underside will be where all electrical components are mounted, with holes drilled and milled accordingly for each mounting screw. The topside will, preferably, be flush with no screws/nuts sticking out or epoxy left un-sanded. All components will have widths short enough to fit within the constraints of the board dimensions leaving no overhanging objects. Grip tape will be applied after all drilling, milling, and sanding has been done to leave a clean topside.

\subsection{Frontend}
\subsubsection{Description}
The Turing Board's remote will be controlled via a phone app available on iOS and Android. The app was built using React Native. The backend is being handled by Google's Firebase API.

\subsection{Dampeners}
\subsubsection{Description}
Excessive vibrations within the electronic housing can cause destructive resonance and render the board non-functional. In order to absorb these vibrations foam dampeners will be installed around all essential parts of the internal components.
\subsubsection{Source}
This requirement comes from the hardware engineers responsible for designing the internal components.
\subsubsection{Constraints}
Foam that is rigid enough to absorb vibrations caused by fast movement over uneven terrain but will not compress enough to cause damage to the internals.
\subsubsection{Standards}
No standards will be used.
\subsubsection{Priority}
High
