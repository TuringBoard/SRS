The Turing Board is ultimately meant to be a full product sent to a customer ready to ride right out of the box. For this reason, the majority of the maintenance and support items are abstracted from the user's view. We will provide a user manual to the user, but other than that it would largely be up to the supporting team to resolve any technical issue with the board. For the app, we are hosting our login admin portal on Google's Firebase Authentication. 

\subsection{Firebase Authentication Admin Portal}
\subsubsection{Description}
The Turing Board's authentication is hosted through Google's Firebase. It currently uses the free Spark Plan. Through this portal, an admin would have the ability to manage users, reset passwords, and monitor authentication usage.
