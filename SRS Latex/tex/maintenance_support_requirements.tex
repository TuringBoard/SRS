The Turing Board is ultimately meant to be a full product sent to a customer ready to ride basically out of the box. For this reason, the majority of the maintenance and support items are abstracted from the user's view. We will provide a user manual to the user, but other than that it would largely be up to the supporting team to resolve any technical issue with the board. For the app, we are hosting our login admin portal on Google's Firebase Authentication.
